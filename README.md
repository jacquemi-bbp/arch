# ARCH


Automated Recognition and Classification of Histological layers.
Machine learning for histological annotation and quantification of cortical layers pipeline


## Main usage
This pipeline automatically detects brain cells, classifies them by brain layer and computes cell density. It has been utilized for rat somatosensory cortex Nissl microscopy images, provided by the EPFL LNMC laboratory.

Utilizing images of tissue stained with the classical cresyl violet, imported into  QuPath projects,
alongside a few QuPath annotations made by experts and metadata in a CSV file, this pipeline generates the boundaries of the somatosensory cortex S1HL layers, the cell densities as function of brain depth and the cell densities per brain layers as presented above:
  - The somatosensory cortex S1HL layers boundaries.

-  Cells densities as function of the percentage of depth inside the somatosensory cortex S1HL.

- The per layer cells densities in the somatosensory cortex S1HL.

## The pipeline consists of two main steps:
1. With the assistance of QuPath (a third-party application), perform cell detection and export cell features and annotations.
2. Process the data exported by QuPath in the previous step to compute the boundaries of the layers and cell densities."

# Pipeline
## Steps to compute the cells densities as function of percentage of the S1HL depth processing
- Read the data inputs exported by QuPath and convert them to cartesian point coordinates and shapely polygon.
- Split the S1HL polygon following the S1HL "top and bottom lines" shapes in n polygons (named spitted_polygon)
- Count the number of cells located in each spitted_polygon
- Compute the volume of each spitted_polygon (mm3)
- Compute the cells densities as function of the percentage of the sscx depth
- Export result files


## Steps to compute the densities per S1HL layers
- Read data inputs from QuPath exported files and convert them to cartesian point coordinates and shapely polygon.
- Train a ML model from GroundTruth data produced by some experts
- Use the ML model to predict and affect a layer for each detected cell
- Define a polygon (alphashape) for each layer based on ML prediction
- Count the number of cells located in each layer polygon
- Compute the volume of each layer polygon (mm3)
- Compute the cells densities for each layer
- Export result files




## Pipeline How To

### Step by step:

1. Detect cells and export their features and the QuPath annotations
   - Edit the qupath_scripts/full_quPath_script.groovy and modify the pathes for the following entries to make them corresponding to your environment:
     - modelPath
     - saveFolderPath
     - CountourFinderPath
     - LayerClassiferPath
   - Create the saveFolderPath if it does not already exist.


- Execute the following groovy script inside the QuPath application or via a script thanks to the QuPath script command:
   - qupath_scripts/full_QuPath_script.groovy


2. Convert the QuPath results to pandas dataframes in batch
   - modify the following entries ./Config/batch_convert.ini with your configuration
     - input_detection_directory
     - input_annotation_directory
     - output_directory
     - pixel_size
   - execute the following python script
   ```shell
   $ pyarch convert --config-file-path ./Config/batch_convert.ini
   ```


3. Convert the QuPath project metadata to a pandas dataframe

   - execute the following python script
   ```shell
   $ pyarch convert-qupath-project --qupath-project-path ProjectQuPath.qpproj --output-path /arch/Results
   ```


4. Compute the  cell densities  as function of brain depth
   - modify ./Config/batch_density_depth with your configuration
     - execute the following python script
   ```shell
   $  pyarch density-per-depth --config-file-path ./Config/batch_density_depth.ini
   ```

5. Predict the layers:
   - execute the following python script
